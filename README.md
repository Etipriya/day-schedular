# Day schedular

This is a daily planner to create a schedule using Javascript application in which we use API(Application Programming Interface) also. It includes:

- Display of current day, date, month and year.

- Various rows with time blocks for standard business hours.

- Including SAVE button which will save the event for that time block.

## Description

We have created:

- Schedule of daily planner.
- Display the current day, date, month and year at the top of the calender.
- Creating time blocks for standard business hours.
- When we view the time block for that day, each time block is color coded to indicate whether it is in present, past or future.
- When we click into a time block, we enter an event.
- On click, on SAVE button, text for that event is stored in local storage.
- On Refresh, the saved events persist.
